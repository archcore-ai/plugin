## Context

The plugin previously required users to install the Archcore CLI out-of-band (via `curl | bash`, `go install`, or package managers) and register the MCP server themselves — either per-user (`claude mcp add archcore archcore mcp -s user`) or per-repo (`.mcp.json` at the project root). This was captured in the Multi-Host Plugin Architecture ADR under the "MCP ownership boundary" section, which justified the choice on the grounds of avoiding Claude Code's duplicate-MCP suppression (v2.1.71+).

In practice this produced real friction:

- First-run onboarding required three separate, correctly-sequenced steps (install CLI → register MCP → reload plugin). Users routinely stopped after `/plugin install`.
- Install scripts (`curl | bash`) are a non-starter in many enterprise environments.
- The `claude mcp add ...` step is discoverable only by reading the README — `/plugin install` gives no hint that MCP registration is still required.
- Error messages from `bin/session-start` when MCP was unreachable ("install the CLI and register the MCP server") were ignored or misread as install failures.

The Claude Code plugin runtime now supports `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` substitution in `.mcp.json` shipped at the plugin root, and treats plugin-provided MCP servers as first-class. Duplicate suppression only kicks in when the `command`/`args` exactly match a user- or project-registered server — and if a user has installed `archcore` globally, the PATH resolution inside the launcher picks it up, so the effective command is identical to the user's global registration and deduping is benign. Codex CLI v0.117.0+ (March 2026) gained plugin-shipped MCP via the Codex manifest's `mcpServers` pointer. Codex uses a different resolution mechanism than Claude Code: rather than env-var substitution in `command`/`args`, it rebases a relative `cwd` field against the plugin install root via `codex-rs/core-plugins/src/loader.rs::normalize_plugin_mcp_server_value`. Codex therefore ships a separate plugin-root MCP config at `.codex.mcp.json` with `command: "./bin/archcore"` and `cwd: "."`. The `cwd: "."` is the resolution mechanism — Codex rebases it to the plugin install root so the relative command resolves correctly regardless of the user's project directory; without `cwd`, Codex spawns from the user's project CWD and the MCP fails with ENOENT. See `plugin/codex-plugin-spawn-semantics.adr.md` for the canonical record on Codex's MCP cwd rebase vs hook `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` substitution.

### Drivers

- Zero-setup install is the single largest adoption lever for the plugin.
- The Go CLI ships single-file binaries per platform via GitHub Releases, making platform-targeted auto-download tractable.
- Enterprise/offline environments can still pin their own binary via `ARCHCORE_BIN` or `ARCHCORE_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1`.

## Decision

**The plugin bundles a shell/PowerShell launcher (`bin/archcore`, `bin/archcore.cmd`, `bin/archcore.ps1`) that resolves the Archcore CLI on demand, and ships host-specific MCP registration files pointing at that launcher.** Claude Code consumes the plugin-root `.mcp.json`; Codex consumes plugin-root `.codex.mcp.json` via `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

### Resolution order (both POSIX and Windows launchers)

1. `$ARCHCORE_BIN` — explicit path to a binary (enterprise pin / local development).
2. `archcore` on `PATH` — respects an existing global install.
3. Plugin-managed cache: `<cache>/archcore-v${VERSION}` where `<cache>` is `$CODEX_PLUGIN_DATA/archcore/cli` → `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/archcore/cli` → `$XDG_DATA_HOME/archcore-plugin/cli` → `$HOME/.local/share/archcore-plugin/cli` (Windows: `$env:CODEX_PLUGIN_DATA\archcore\cli` → `$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA\archcore\cli` → `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\archcore-plugin\cli`).
4. Download from `github.com/archcore-ai/cli/releases/download/v${VERSION}/archcore_<os>_<arch>.{tar.gz,zip}`, verify against `checksums.txt` (SHA-256), atomically install into the cache, then `exec`.

`ARCHCORE_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` disables step 4 and exits 1 instead — used by `bin/session-start` to keep SessionStart non-blocking on first run. The first MCP tool call triggers the download instead.

The cache directory list is host-aware: when running under Codex CLI the launcher prefers `$CODEX_PLUGIN_DATA`; under Claude Code it prefers `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`. Both fall through to the XDG/LOCALAPPDATA layer if the host data dir is unset, so existing installs keep working. The cache file itself is version-keyed by filename (`archcore-v${VERSION}`), so even if Codex and Claude Code share a binary cache via a common XDG fallback, no conflict is possible.

### MCP registration

The plugin root ships `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archcore": {
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/archcore",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Code reads this and registers `archcore` as a plugin-provided MCP server. The command points at the launcher — the launcher resolves to the right binary at invocation time. Resolution mechanism: env-var substitution at the host level (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is replaced with the plugin install path before spawn).

Codex CLI reads `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and follows its `mcpServers` pointer to `.codex.mcp.json`. The Codex build-plugins docs reserve `.codex-plugin/` for `plugin.json`, so the Codex-specific MCP file lives at the plugin root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": "./.codex.mcp.json"
}
```

The pointed-to file uses the same wrapper shape as public Codex plugin examples, with the addition of a `cwd` field that's the resolution mechanism for Codex:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archcore": {
      "command": "./bin/archcore",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "cwd": "."
    }
  }
}
```

Codex resolves the command via its `cwd` rebase mechanism: `normalize_plugin_mcp_server_value` (`codex-rs/core-plugins/src/loader.rs`) rebases the relative `cwd` (`.`) to the plugin install root; `launch_server` (`codex-rs/rmcp-client/src/stdio_server_launcher.rs`) then sets that as `current_dir` for the spawned process, so `./bin/archcore` resolves against the plugin root rather than the user's project CWD. This avoids relying on an undocumented `${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable (Codex does not export one to MCP processes, nor does it substitute env-var placeholders in MCP `command`/`args`) while still using the same launcher and cache behavior. Without `cwd: "."`, Codex would spawn the MCP from the user's project CWD and fail with ENOENT — the original symptom that motivated the spawn-semantics investigation. See `plugin/codex-plugin-spawn-semantics.adr.md`.

### Pinned CLI version

`bin/CLI_VERSION` is a single-line file containing the semver of the CLI release the plugin is tested against (currently `0.1.7`). The launcher reads this and uses it for cache keying and the download URL. Bumping the plugin's CLI pin is a one-file change.

### Checksum verification

Downloads are verified against the release's `checksums.txt` using `sha256sum` or `shasum -a 256` (POSIX) / `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256` (Windows). Mismatches abort the install. No fallback: if checksums can't be computed, the launcher refuses to run the binary.

### Windows-specific handling

`bin/archcore.ps1` strips the Mark-of-the-Web ADS via `Unblock-File` after staging, so Windows SmartScreen does not prompt on first execution. Architecture detection uses `RuntimeInformation.OSArchitecture` (not process architecture) so x64 PowerShell running under ARM64 Prism emulation still installs the correct ARM64 binary.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Keep external-only CLI install (status quo)

Continue requiring users to install the CLI separately and register MCP themselves.

**Rejected because:** The friction is load-bearing in a way that blocks adoption. Every reported "plugin doesn't work" issue traced back to incomplete CLI/MCP setup. The multi-host ADR's original rationale (avoiding duplicate-suppression) is solved differently — by the launcher deferring to `PATH` when a global install exists.

### 2. Ship the CLI binary directly in the plugin repo

Vendor per-platform binaries under `bin/vendor/` and pick one at hook invocation time.

**Rejected because:**
- Inflates the plugin repo to ~60MB (four platform binaries).
- Marketplace distribution becomes version-coupled to the CLI — every CLI release forces a plugin release.
- License/provenance surface area grows (signed binaries in a plugin repo raise supply-chain review flags).

### 3. Post-install script via the marketplace

Run a `postInstall` hook to download and install the CLI when the plugin is first installed.

**Rejected because:**
- Claude Code and Cursor plugin runtimes differ in lifecycle-hook support (Cursor has none equivalent).
- First-run-at-install is the wrong place to fail; first-run-at-use lets the user see the one-time download as progress feedback.

### 4. Keep MCP out of the plugin, only ship the launcher

Add `bin/archcore` but leave MCP registration to the user.

**Rejected because:** It solves only half the friction. The whole point is eliminating the `claude mcp add` step.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Zero-setup install.** `/plugin install archcore` is the only required user action. First MCP call triggers a one-time ~5s download.
- **Respects existing installs.** Users who already have `archcore` on `PATH` (via Homebrew, `go install`, enterprise package) hit that binary — no conflict, no duplicate cache, no surprise.
- **Enterprise/offline escape hatches.** `ARCHCORE_BIN` pins an explicit binary. `ARCHCORE_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` disables network access at the launcher layer.
- **Survives plugin updates.** The cache lives under `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/archcore/cli` (Claude Code's stable data dir) or `$CODEX_PLUGIN_DATA/archcore/cli` (Codex CLI's stable data dir), so plugin re-installs don't re-download.
- **Security.** Downloads are checksum-verified before execution. No `curl | sh`.
- **Codex parity with Claude Code.** Codex CLI uses the same launcher mechanism with a Codex-specific MCP config: `command: "./bin/archcore"` paired with `cwd: "."`, where Codex's `normalize_plugin_mcp_server_value` rebases the relative cwd to the plugin install root. Host-prefixed cache directories keep the binary lifecycle aligned with Claude Code. The resolution mechanism differs from Claude Code (cwd rebase vs env-var substitution), but the user experience is identical: zero-setup install, plugin-shipped MCP, same launcher binary, same cache.

### Negative

- **Plugin now owns part of the CLI lifecycle.** Cache invalidation (stale cached binaries after CLI bugfix releases) requires bumping `bin/CLI_VERSION` in the plugin and shipping a plugin release. Mitigation: cache is version-keyed by filename (`archcore-v${VERSION}`), so a pin bump always downloads fresh.
- **First-run network dependency.** Air-gapped environments that don't pre-install the CLI fail at the first MCP call with a network error. Mitigation: documented `ARCHCORE_BIN` / `ARCHCORE_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` workflow in the README.
- **Cursor remains the multi-host outlier.** Claude Code and Codex CLI both support plugin-shipped MCP configs (via different mechanisms — env-var substitution and `cwd` rebase respectively); Cursor does not. Cursor users still register MCP externally (via project `mcp.json` or Cursor MCP settings). The launcher still works for them — it just isn't wired in via a plugin-shipped `.mcp.json`. This is a deliberate host-by-host rollout; the ADR does not claim parity across all hosts.
- **Inverts the Multi-Host Plugin Architecture ADR's "MCP ownership boundary" section.** That section is now historically accurate (rationale at the time) but no longer describes current behavior. See that ADR for the cross-link; this ADR supersedes the "plugin does not ship an MCP server configuration" claim for Claude Code and (by extension) Codex CLI specifically.
- **Supply-chain surface area.** The launcher executes downloaded binaries. Checksum verification is the only gate. Any compromise of the GitHub Releases signing pipeline compromises the plugin's trust model. Acceptable given the CLI was the trust root already; the launcher doesn't introduce a new trust boundary.
