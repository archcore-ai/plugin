> **Outcome (2026-05-15):** Decision accepted as-is, but Layer 3 shipped as the `--drift` mode of `/archcore:audit` rather than as a standalone `/archcore:actualize` intent skill (see `skill-surface-collapse.adr.md`). The 3-layer architecture, detection dimensions, and naming rationale below remain authoritative; substitute `/archcore:audit --drift` for `/archcore:actualize` throughout.

## Context

The Archcore Plugin has a comprehensive validation system (PreToolUse blocking, PostToolUse validation via `archcore doctor`) that ensures **structural integrity** of `.archcore/` documents. The `/archcore:audit` skill (formerly `/archcore:review`) provides on-demand health checks for coverage gaps, relation health, and status issues.

However, no mechanism detected when documentation **content becomes stale**. Three types of staleness went undetected:

1. **Document cascade**: Updating document A while documents that `implements`, `depends_on`, or `extends` A remain unchanged. Example: PRD is rewritten but the plan that `implements` it still describes the old scope.
2. **Code-document drift**: Source code changes that invalidate assumptions, APIs, or patterns described in archcore documents. Example: auth module is refactored but the ADR still describes the old JWT strategy.
3. **Temporal staleness**: Documents stuck in inappropriate statuses — long-lived drafts, plans with passed deadlines, rejected documents still referenced in active chains.

At the time this ADR was drafted, staleness was only discovered during manual audit invocations or when someone happened to read an outdated document. There was no proactive or reactive detection.

## Decision

Add a 3-layer Actualize system that detects documentation staleness at increasing depths, building on the existing hook and skill infrastructure.

### Layer 1 — Passive Detection (SessionStart hook enhancement)

Extend `bin/session-start` to run a lightweight git-based staleness check at every session start. Compare code file changes since the last `.archcore/` modification. If significant drift detected, inject a brief warning into session context (max 2KB, within the 10KB `additionalContext` budget).

**Mechanism**: `git log` to find last `.archcore/` commit, `git diff --name-only` to find code changes since, `grep -rl` in `.archcore/` to find documents referencing changed paths.

**Character**: Informational only. Never blocks session start, never modifies documents.

### Layer 2 — Reactive Cascade Detection (PostToolUse hook)

Add cascade detection logic to the PostToolUse hook pipeline. After `mcp__archcore__update_document`, query the relation graph for documents connected to the updated document via `implements`, `depends_on`, or `extends` relations (where the updated document is the target). Inject a cascade warning naming potentially affected documents.

**Mechanism**: Parse updated document path from tool input, query the `.sync-state.json` relation graph, filter by directional relation types.

**Character**: Informational only. Injected as `additionalContext` after the update succeeds. Never blocks operations.

### Layer 3 — Deep Analysis (drift mode of /archcore:audit)

Add comprehensive staleness analysis on demand. Three detection dimensions:

- **Code→Doc drift**: For each document, find referenced code paths in content, check `git log` for changes since document was last modified.
- **Doc→Doc cascade**: For recently updated documents, traverse the relation graph to find stale dependents.
- **Temporal**: Draft documents older than 30 days, accepted plans with past deadlines, rejected documents still in active relation chains.

Offers interactive assisted fixes via MCP `update_document`.

> When this ADR was originally drafted, Layer 3 was to ship as a standalone `/archcore:actualize` intent skill (8th primary command). It later shipped as the `--drift` mode of the unified `/archcore:audit` skill per `skill-surface-collapse.adr.md`.

### Naming

The system is called Actualize because:
- `refresh` implies reloading data, not content analysis
- `sync` implies bidirectional synchronization (misleading)
- `update` conflicts with `update_document` MCP tool name
- `actualize` means "make current and relevant" — exactly the intent

### Detection direction for cascade (Layer 2)

When document A is updated, which documents may be stale?

| Relation direction | Relation type | Stale document | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| B `implements` A | implements | B | B's implementation of A may be outdated |
| B `depends_on` A | depends_on | B | B's assumptions about A may be invalid |
| B `extends` A | extends | B | B's extensions of A may be incompatible |

`related` relations are excluded — too loose, would create noise.

### Scope constraints

- Layer 1 (passive): read-only, max 2KB output, max 3s execution
- Layer 2 (reactive): read-only, within PostToolUse 3s budget, fires only on `update_document`
- Layer 3 (deep): interactive, can modify via MCP with user confirmation, no time limit

## Alternatives Considered

### Only enhance /archcore:audit (dashboard/deep modes)

Add staleness checks to the existing audit skill's dashboard or `--deep` mode. **Initially rejected** because review/audit was on-demand only — no passive or reactive detection. The actualize system catches staleness automatically via hooks. **Later partially reconsidered**: Layer 3 of this decision was folded into `/archcore:audit --drift` per `skill-surface-collapse.adr.md`, but Layer 1 and Layer 2 (the hook-driven detection) remained separate as designed.

### Background polling via /loop

Use Claude Code's `/loop` command to periodically check for staleness. **Rejected**: requires a persistent session open in terminal, wasteful of resources, and stops when the user closes the terminal.

### MCP-side staleness check

Add `check_staleness` command to the archcore CLI itself. **Deferred, not rejected**: good for cross-tool portability. The plugin-side implementation delivers value now without CLI changes. If the CLI adds this later, the hook can delegate to it.

### Git pre-commit hook (outside Claude Code)

Check staleness before git commits. **Rejected**: wrong timing — by the time the user commits, they've already been working with potentially stale docs. Session-start is when they can act.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Staleness detected at session start — before the user makes decisions based on outdated documentation
- Cascade effects surfaced immediately after document updates — no silent drift
- Deep analysis available on demand for thorough cleanup sessions
- Builds entirely on existing infrastructure (hooks, bin scripts, MCP tools, relation graph)
- All detection is transparent and informational — never destructive, never blocking

### Negative

- **Git dependency**: Layer 1 and Layer 3 code-doc drift require git history. Must degrade gracefully if git is unavailable or `.archcore/` is not committed.
- **Heuristic false positives**: File-path matching in Layer 1 may flag documents that reference a directory where unrelated files changed. Acceptable tradeoff — false positives are informational nudges, not errors.
- **SessionStart latency**: Layer 1 adds ~1-2 seconds to session startup for git operations. Acceptable — already within the 3-second budget and user expects startup to load context.
- **PostToolUse overhead**: Layer 2 adds relation graph query after every `update_document`. Must complete within existing 3-second timeout.
- **Skill surface**: When this ADR was drafted, the cost was "Layer 1 intent skills go from 7 to 8." That cost was later eliminated by folding Layer 3 into the existing `audit` skill as `--drift`.

### Supersedes

- (none — this is a net addition to the plugin)

### Superseded by (partially)

- The standalone `/archcore:actualize` skill described in this ADR was superseded by `skill-surface-collapse.adr.md`. Layer 3 ships as `/archcore:audit --drift`; Layers 1 and 2 remain as designed.
